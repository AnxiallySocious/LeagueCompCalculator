# LeagueCompCalculator
An example project that uses the Riot API to calculate a winning champion in the popular game League of Legends

You are welcome to update the roles as you see fit.
The data provided is limited, but sufficient. It is taken entirely from Challenger games.
If you want to try running it yourself to collect more data, it will require an API key from Riot, but the system is fully functional.

To run it yourself (and keep my data), download the json files, the run.bat, and the zip file that contains the jar. Place them into the same location, and run! Enjoy.
